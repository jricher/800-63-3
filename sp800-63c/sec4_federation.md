## 4. Federation
Federation is a process that allows for the conveyance of identity and authentication information across a set of networked systems. In a federation scenario, the verifier or CSP is often known as the *identity provider*, or IdP.

**Figure 1: Federation**

In a federation protocol, a triangle is formed between the subscriber, the CSP, and the RP (Figure 1). Depending on the specifics of the protocol, different information passes across each leg of the triangle at different times. The subscriber communicates with both the CSP and the RP, usually through a web browser. The RP communicates with the CSP, though this communication can happen indirectly (through redirects involving the subscriber), directly (through a back-channel connection), or via a packaged information bundle (such as a cryptographically protected and self-contained assertion).

The subscriber authenticates to the CSP using some form of primary credential, and then that authentication event is asserted to the RP across the network. The CSP can also make attribute statements about the subscriber as part of this process. These attributes and authentication event information are usually carried to the RP through the use of an assertion (see section 5.).

The RP communication with the CSP reveals to the CSP where the subscriber is conducting a transaction. Communications from multiple RPs allow the CSP to build a profile of subscriber transactions that would not have existed absent federation. This aggregation could enable new capabilities for subscriber tracking and use of profile information that do not align with the privacy interests of the subscribers. 

Unless the subscriber consents, the CSP SHALL NOT disclose information on subscriber activities with an RP to any party, nor use the information for any purpose other than federated authentication or to comply with law or legal process. The CSP SHOULD employ technical measures to provide unlinkability and prevent subscriber activity tracking and profiling.

### 4.1. Federation Models

This section provides an overview of a few common models of identity federation currently in use. In these models, trust is established between members of the federation in several different ways. Some models mandate that federated parties have a high level of trust. Other models allow for parties with a diversity of trust relationships.

#### 4.1.1 Central Authority

Some federated parties trust a central authority to make trust decisions for them and communicate metadata between parties. In this model, the central authority generally conducts some level of vetting on each party in the federation to verify compliance with predetermined security and integrity standards.

Most federations using the central authority model have a single level of trust - either parties are in the federation or they are not. However, more sophisticated federations have multiple tiers of trust which can be used by federated parties to tell whether other parties in the federation have been more thoroughly vetted or have some common purpose that justifies a higher level of trust. This higher level of trust makes some parties in the federation more likely to automatically release information about their users to the parties in the higher tiers.

#### 4.1.2 Manual Registration

In the manual registration model of federation, system administrators communicate metadata and test system interoperability before transactions take place between users over the wire. Metadata for each party who wishes to participate is manually input into a registry of federated parties. Each party maintains their own registry of other parties whom they have deemed trustworthy.

Manual registration can take place on a case by case basis without any authority or federation operator in place. In this case, an existing pairwise trust relationship is generally already in place between the CSP and the RP. 

Manual registration can work in concert with a central authority model. In this case, a registry is pre-populated with parties trusted by the central authority, and more parties are added manually on an as-needed basis.

#### <a name="dynamic-registration"></a> 4.1.3 Dynamic Registration

In the dynamic registration model of federation, systems have a well-known location where other systems can find their metadata. They also have predictable API endpoints where new systems can register themselves without human involvement. Systems that make use of dynamic registration SHOULD require verifiable human interaction, such as the approval of the identity federation transaction by the authenticated subscriber at the CSP. 

Frequently, parties in a dynamic registration model have no way to trust each other ahead of time, so little information is exchanged by default. This problem is somewhat mitigated by a technology called software statements, which allow federated parties to cryptographically verify some attributes of the parties involved in dynamic registration. Software statements are lists of attributes describing the RP software, cryptographically signed by certifying bodies. Because both parties trust the certifying body, that trust can be extended to the other party in the dynamic registration partnership.  This allows trust to be established or elevated between the federating parties. See [[RFC 7591 Section 2.3]] (#RFC7591Sec23) for more information.

Many federated parties establish whitelists of other federated parties who may dynamically register with some predetermined level of trust. They also establish blacklists of federated parties who may be allowed dynamically register with a low level of trust, or who may not be allowed to dynamically register at all. Everything that is not on a whitelist or a blacklist can be considered to be in a gray area or on a "graylist." Graylisted parties generally start out with a low level of trust until they can be reviewed by a human who can determine an appropriate level of trust. 

#### 4.1.4 Brokered Federation

In this model, a third-party sits in the middle of the transaction and communicates the success or failure of an authentication event at the CSP to the RP. Effectively, a broker functions as a federation CSP on one side and a federation RP on the other side. Therefore, all normative and non-normative requirements that apply to CSPs and RPs in this chapter SHALL apply to the broker.

![Figure 2: Broker](sp800-63c/media/broker.png)

**Figure 2: Broker**

 

Brokers can enable simplified technical integrations between the RP and CSP by eliminating the need for multiple point to point integrations, which can be onerous for protocols which do not support [dynamic registration](#dynamic-registration). If implemented in very specific ways, brokers can also provide some business confidentiality and transfer some of the privacy risks of point to point federation described above by passing the assertions while blinding the participants on either side of the transaction to each other. For example, organizations may not wish to reveal their subscriber lists to each other and some implementations of blinding technology somewhat prevent the capability for CSPs or RPs to track and profile subscribers. However, this model transfers this capability to the broker.  While the use of brokers can give the appearance of complete privacy preservation, in many instances the implementation of broker technology still allows the tracking of subscribers, CSPs, and RPs in different ways.  

While some broker deployments offer no additional privacy protection, some can offer limited additional levels of privacy to the subscriber through a variety of blinding technologies.  However, as the level of blinding increases, so does the technical implementation complexity. Privacy policies may dictate appropriate use by the CSP, RP, and the broker,  but blinding technology can increase effectiveness of these policies by making the data more difficult to access.

1. The broker does not blind the RP and CSP from one another. The broker is able to monitor and track all subscriber relationships between the RPs and CSPs, and has visibility into any attributes it is transmitting in the assertion.

1. The broker does not blind the RP and CSP from one another. The broker is able to monitor and track all subscriber relationships between the RPs and CSPs, but has no visibility into any attributes it is transmitting in the assertion.

1. The broker blinds the RP and CSP from each other. The broker is able to monitor and track all subscriber relationships between the RPs and CSPs, but has no visibility into any attributes it is transmitting in the assertion.

1. The broker blinds the RP, CSP, and itself. The broker cannot monitor or track any subscriber relationships, and has no visibility into any attributes it is transmitting in the assertion. 
 
NOTE: even with the use of blinding technologies, it is often possible for a blinded party to deduce subscriber behavior patterns through analysis of timestamps, cookies, attributes, or attribute bundle sizes.
