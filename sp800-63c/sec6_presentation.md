## 6. Assertion Presentation

Assertions MAY be presented in either an *indirect* or *direct* manner from the CSP to the RP. Each model has its benefits and drawbacks, but both require the proper validation of the assertion. Assertions MAY also be proxied to facilitate federation between CSPs and RPs under specific circumstances, as discussed in section 4.1.4.

Positive confirmation SHALL be obtained from the subscriber before any attributes about the subscriber are transmitted to any RP. If the protocol in use allows for optional attributes, the subscriber SHALL be given the option to decide whether transmit those attributes to the RP. These requirements do not apply to cases where the subscriber has already consented to release the exact attribute bundle requested at the same RP before or has a reasonable expectation of attribute sharing, such as in cases where the RP and the CSP are the same legal entity.
The CSP SHALL transmit only those attributes that were explicitly requested by the RP.

### 6.1. Indirect presentation

In the *indirect* model, the subscriber is given an assertion reference to present to the RP, such as an HTTP redirect. The assertion reference itself contains no information about the subscriber. The RP presents the assertion reference to the CSP, usually along with authentication of the RP itself, to fetch the assertion.

**Figure 1: Indirect presentation**

In this model, the assertion itself is requested directly from the CSP to the RP, minimizing chances of interception and manipulation by a third party (including the subscriber themselves). This also allows the RP to query the CSP for additional attributes about the subscriber not included in the assertion itself.

The assertion is still considered a *bearer* assertion if the artifact required to fetch the Assertion does not require presentation of additional proof of key possession after the assertion has been fetched.

In the indirect method, there are more network transactions required, but the information is limited to the parties that need it. Since an RP is expecting to get an assertion only from the CSP directly, the attack surface is reduced.

Claims within the assertion SHALL be validated including issuer verification, signature validation, and audience restriction.

Conveyance of the assertion reference from the CSP to the subscriber as well as from the subscriber to the RP SHALL be made over an authenticated protected channel. Conveyance of the assertion reference from the RP to the CSP as well as the assertion from the CSP to the RP SHALL be made over an authenticated protected channel.

### 6.2. Direct Presentation

In the *direct* model, the CSP creates an assertion and sends it directly to the subscriber after successful authentication. The assertion is used by the subscriber to authenticate to the RP. This is often handled by mechanisms within the subscriber’s browser.)

**Figure 2: Direct presentation**

In the direct method, an assertion is visible to the user, which could potentially cause leakage of system information included in the assertion. Since the assertion is visible to the subscriber, the direct method also allows the assertion to be replayed to other RPs by the subscriber. 

The RP SHALL protect itself against injection of manufactured or captured assertions by use of cross-site scripting protection or other accepted techniques. 

The assertion SHALL be validated including issuer verification, signature validation, and audience restriction.

Conveyance of the assertion from the CSP to the subscriber as well as from the subscriber to the RP SHALL be made over an authenticated protected channel.

### 6.3. Assertion proxying

In some implementations, a proxy takes in an assertion from the CSP and creates a derived assertion when interacting directly with the RP, acting as an intermediary between the subscriber, the CSP, and the RP. From the perspective of the true CSP, the proxy is a single RP. From the perspective of the true RPs, the proxy is a single CSP. (See section 4.1.4.) 

There are several common reasons for such proxies:

- Portals that provide users access to multiple RPs that require user authentication

- Web caching mechanisms that are required to satisfy the RP’s access control policies, especially when client-authenticated TLS with the subscriber is used

- Network monitoring and/or filtering mechanisms that terminate TLS in order to inspect and manipulate the traffic

Conveyance of all information SHALL be made over authenticated protected channels.

### 6.4. Protecting Information

Communications between the CSP and the RP SHALL be protected in transit using an authenticated protected channel.

Note that the CSP may have access to information that may be useful to the RP in enforcing security policies, such as device identity, location, system health checks, and configuration management. If so, it may be a good idea to pass this information along to the RP within the bounds of the subscriber's privacy preferences.

Additional attributes about the user MAY be included outside of the assertion itself as part of a separate authorized request from the RP to the CSP. The authorization for access to these attributes MAY be issued alongside the assertion itself. Splitting user information in this manner can aid in protecting user privacy and allow for limited disclosure of identifying attributes on top of the essential information in the authentication assertion itself.
